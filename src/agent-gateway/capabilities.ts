/**
 * Machine-readable enforcement contract for the Agent Gateway authorizer.
 *
 * ## Why this module exists
 *
 * The authorizer runs the *same* `evaluateToolCallDefense` pipeline as the local
 * proxies, which makes it look like full Shield Desktop parity. It is not, and
 * the difference is invisible from the outside: a strategy whose container,
 * identity, or shared state is missing returns `null`, and `null` means "no
 * verdict, keep going". Several of those strategies therefore do nothing at all
 * in this deployment while every log line still reads like a healthy
 * authorization.
 *
 * That is the same failure shape as fabricating a metric -- the system reports
 * work it did not do. So instead of asserting parity, this module reports what is
 * actually live, and `index.ts` refuses to serve when a required capability is
 * missing instead of quietly degrading.
 *
 * ## The three-way contract
 *
 * `enforcement` records *where* a control can legitimately run, which is the
 * honest replacement for a parity claim:
 *
 * - `gateway`   -- decided here, on this request.
 * - `upstream`  -- decided by Agent Identity + IAP IAM Unified Access Policies
 *                  before the request reaches this service. Not re-checked here
 *                  because the extension cannot observe the identity.
 * - `desktop-only` -- structurally impossible at an egress authorizer.
 *
 * ## Invariants
 *
 *  1. Every capability carries a non-empty `detail`. A `live` state with no
 *     reason is indistinguishable from a guess, which is what this module exists
 *     to prevent.
 *  2. `state` is derived from real runtime state (`isAgenticEnabled()`,
 *     `isRedisConfigured()`, `OPA_URL`, `MASTYF_AI_STRICT_MODE`), never from
 *     operator intent.
 *  3. Nothing here changes a verdict. It reports. Enforcement stays in the
 *     policy engine and the fail-closed paths in `decision-core.ts`.
