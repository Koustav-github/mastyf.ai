/**
 * Shared token estimate derived from tool-call arguments.
 *
 * ## Why this is its own module
 *
 * Two call sites need the same number and must not disagree:
 *
 *  - `PolicyEngine.effectiveRequestTokens`, which applies it as a *floor* over
 *    whatever the transport reported.
 *  - The Agent Gateway authorizer, which has no transport-reported count at all
 *    and would otherwise report zero.
 *
 * When the gateway carried a private copy of this logic it drifted, and the
 * consequence was invisible: the engine's `maxTokens` rules kept working (they
 * go through the floor) while four consumers that read `ctx.requestTokens`
 * directly -- `loop-anomaly-detector`, `token-budget-strategy-legacy`,
 * `session-flow-guard`, and `user-tool-enforcement` -- plus the post-policy
 * spend reservation in `proxy-post-allow-gates` all saw zero. That is what a
 * duplicated estimator actually costs, and it is why there is exactly one.
 *
 * ## This is an estimate, not a measurement
 *
 * It is a guard input, not an accounting input. It is deliberately never used
 * for billing: cost auditing reads real tokenizer counts from proxy records
 * (`cost-auditor.ts`), and a request authorized at the gateway produces no such
 * record. Callers that persist this number must label it as an estimate.
